Table 1 gives concrete examples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class $O$ . Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class $O$ is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Dataimbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Koˇcisk\\`y et al., 2018; Dasigi et al., 2019) with the value of negative-positive ratio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the starting and ending indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.

This actually creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, whereas at test time, F1 gives equal weight to positive and negative examples; (2) the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples. As pointed out by Meng et al. (2019), a significantly large number of negative examples also means that the number of easy-negative example is large. The huge number of easy examples tends to overwhelm the training, making the model not sufficiently learn to distinguish between positive examples and hard-negative examples. The crossentropy objective (CE for short) or maximum likelihood (MLE) objective, which is widely adopted as the training objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks (Lample et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018a; McCann et al., 2018; Ma and Hovy, 2016; Chen et al., 2017), handles neither of the issues.

The Sørensen–Dice coefficient, dice loss for short, is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It attaches equal importance to false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) and is thus more immune to data-imbalanced datasets. Tversky index extends dice loss by using a weight that trades precision and recall, which can be thought as the approximation of the $F_{\\beta}$ score, and thus comes with more flexibility. Therefore, we use dice loss or Tversky index to replace CE loss to address the first issue. ",

This is intrinsically because dice loss is actually a soft version of the F1 score. Taking the binary classification task as an example, at test time, an example will be classified as negative as long as its probability is smaller than 0.5, but training will push the value to 0 as much as possible. This gap isn’t a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easynegative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones. Inspired by the idea of focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) in computer vision, we propose a dynamic weight adjusting strategy, which associates each training example with a weight in proportion to $(1-p)$ , and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds. This strategy helps deemphasize confident examples during training as their probability $p$ approaches 1, making the model attentive to hard-negative examples, and thus alleviates the dominating effect of easy-negative examples. Combing both strategies, we observe significant performance boosts on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. ",

Boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost (Kanduri et al., 2018) select harder examples to train subsequent classifiers. Similarly, hard example mining (Malisiewicz et al., 2011) downsamples the majority class and exploits the most difficult examples. Oversampling (Chen et al., 2010; Chawla et al., 2002) is used to balance the data distribution. Another line of data resampling is to dynamically control the weights of examples as training proceeds. For example, focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) used a soft weighting scheme that emphasizes harder examples during training. In self-paced learning (Kumar et al., 2010), example weights are obtained through optimizing the weighted training loss which encourages learning easier examples first. At each training step, selfpaced learning algorithm optimizes model parameters and example weights jointly. Other works (Chang et al., 2017; Katharopoulos and Fleuret, 2018) adjusted the weights of different training examples based on training loss. Besides, recent work (Jiang et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2018) proposed to learn a separate network to predict sample weights. ",

The data resampling strategy constructs a new dataset by sampling training examples from the original dataset based on human-designed criteria, e.g. extracting equal training samples from each class. Both strategies are equivalent to changing the data distribution during training and thus are of the same nature.
